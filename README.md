# LINGUAMORPH

The Linguamorph software was created by Arno Klein (binarybottle.com) 
and is intended to process/morph language, including variations in sound and stress.

Potential applications include:

  - language learning (see lingualearn)
  - homophone phrases (variations that sound the same or similar)
  - extreme alliteration
  - spoonerism-style scrambles
  - homophone anagrams
  - homophone loops
  - shrinking and expanding text
  - two different stories that sound the same
  - text that morphs to text with meaningful intermediates
  - stress-rhythm-seeded text
  - faux/foe translations
  - rhyming/rapping


linguamorph.py is the main program to run Linguamorph language morphing software.
Ex: python linguamorph.py -mh 'pair of shoes' -l words


## Phonemes and Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary

This software makes use of different dictionaries as lexicons, but make primary use of [CMU's Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) [github](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict/tree/4c6a365cea2c34340ffc218d5af7a38920fa7e37]). See below and the documents/ folder for more information about this dictionary:

From https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/corpus/reader/cmudict.html:

The Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary [cmudict.0.6]
Copyright 1998 Carnegie Mellon University

File Format: Each line consists of an uppercased word, a counter
(for alternative pronunciations), and a transcription.  Vowels are
marked for stress (1=primary, 2=secondary, 0=no stress).  E.g.:
NATURAL 1 N AE1 CH ER0 AH0 L

The dictionary contains 127069 entries.  Of these, 119400 words are assigned
a unique pronunciation, 6830 words have two pronunciations, and 839 words have
three or more pronunciations.  Many of these are fast-speech variants.

Phonemes: There are 39 phonemes (more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET):

From https://www.pythonstudio.us/language-processing/a-pronouncing-dictionary.html:
For each word, this lexicon provides a list of phonetic codes — distinct labels for each contrastive sound — known as phones. Observe that fire has two pronunciations (in U.S. English): the one-syllable F AY1 R, and the two-syllable F AY1 ER0. The symbols in the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary are from the Arpabet, described in more detail at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpabet.
